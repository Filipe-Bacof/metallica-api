## Dedication and Thanks

- I've been a big fan of metallica since I was a child, more than two decades listening to these guys' magnificent sound.
- I dedicate this API to all fans who appreciate the music, mission and work of these rock stars ðŸ¤˜
- I also dedicate this small programming work in honor of the great Cliff Burton, one of the greatest bass players who ever walked the earth, who left us after an accident on September 27, 1986. Rest in Peace!

- [x] Seeder for database initialization.
- [ ] Pagination of results for some endpoints.
- [ ] Endpoints to perform CRUD operations, obviously with authentication.

## About deployment

- Currently the deployment is done at [Render](https://render.com/) and their only free server is in the United States, so there may be a small delay in the first request, you can test the `/` endpoint which should return `Let's Rock! ðŸ¤˜ðŸ˜ŽðŸ”¥`.
