They do not know\nStiffened wounds test their pride\nMen of five, still alive through the raging glow\nGone insane from the pain that they surely know\n\nFor whom the bell tolls\nTime marches on\nFor whom the bell tolls\n\nTake a look to the sky just before you die\nIt's the last time you will\nBlackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky\nShattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry\nStranger now are his eyes to this mystery\nHe hears the silence so loud\nCrack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be\nNow they see what will be, blinded eyes to see\n\nFor whom the bell tolls\nTime marches on\nFor whom the bell tolls",

You'll feel our hell on your back\nBlood follows blood and we make sure\nLife ain't for you and we're the cure\nHonesty is my only excuse\nTry to rob us of it, but it's no use\nSteamroller action crushing all\nVictim is your name and you shall fall\n\nBlood will follow blood\nDying time is here\nDamage Incorporated\n\nWe chew and spit you out\nWe laugh, you scream and shout\nAll flee, with fear you run\nYou'll know just where we come from\n\nDamage Incorporated\nGo\n\nDamage jackals ripping right through you\nSight and smell of this, it gets me goin'\nKnow just how to get just what we want\nTear it from your soul in nightly hunt\nFuck it all and fuckin' no regrets\nNever happy ending on these dark sets\nAll's fair for Damage Inc. You see\nStep a little closer if you please\n\nBlood will follow blood\nDying time is here\nDamage Incorporated",
