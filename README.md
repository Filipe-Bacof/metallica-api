## Dedication

- I've been a big fan of metallica since I was a child, more than two decades listening to these guys' magnificent sound.
- I dedicate this API to all fans who appreciate the music, mission and work of these rock stars ðŸ¤˜
- I also dedicate this small programming work in honor of the great Cliff Burton, one of the greatest bass players who ever walked the earth, who left us after an accident on September 27, 1986. Rest in Peace!
